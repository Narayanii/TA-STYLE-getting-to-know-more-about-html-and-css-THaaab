<h2>Mantra Tea is an initiative developed by some
friends who desired to add Beauty and Tranquility in this world by the work they do and the way they live.</h2>

<p>Once those friends were sitting and  enjoying  freshly  brewed herbal teas in the Himalayan Mount ains . They viewed life on earth as  sacred  including the teas  they  loved.  From  this collective feeling of sacredness emerged the idea of Mantra Tea Since then, these  friends  have  been  crafting finest  blends  of teas from carefully selected, pure & fresh organic herbs.

<p>Mantra tea's hand crafted tea bags are made in a sacred atmosphere with continuous chants of Shanti (Peace) Mantra being played with deep intentions of establishing Peace , Love and Harmony in the world. Each tea bag (potli) is made with eco-consciousness using muslin cloth which is pre washed for 24 hours. As a token of our gratitude towards Mother Nature-Mantra Tea's eco-packaging is 100% Earth friendly. </p>
